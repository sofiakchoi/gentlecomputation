        <p>In Jorge Luis Borges short story <i>The Library of Babel</i>, humanity exists in an expansive library
            composed of hexagonal shelves containing every possible combination of 25 characters. Every piece of
            knowledge, every fact about the future or past, is contained within the shelves. Librarians browse the
            galleries, searching for lines of meaning amongst nonsense. We live in a noisy world. The internet is as
            endless as Borges library. Chattering away, it assaults us with a barrage of constant information. Every
            second something is clicked, reposted, shared.
            <br>
            Fundementally, users do not understand the conduits through
            which
            they explore the web. There is a great mystification of technology, and a mythologizing of those who build
            and understand it. Tech billionaires demand to be viewed as a priestly caste, the holy
            channel our Machine-God travels through. This widening knowledge gap disempowers users, encouraging
            apathy and deference in
            those who do not believe they could build a better alternative. We have trended towards efficiency at the
            cost of humanity. In the platformatized world, everything must be
            smooth, optimized, and user-tested. The proliferation of LLMs is the natural conclusion to this efficiency
            economy, it offers a sedated, stupified life: never make a difficult choice, never search introspectively for
            an answer, ask your machine-god, and those who program it, to decide for you. Uber instead of walking, have ChatGPT write your emails,
            DoorDash all your groceries—forget all the inconvenience of your life, the essential human friction that
            begets discovery. The drive for technology based on convenience and efficiency is useful when we operate
            from a point of scarcity, but here, in the Global North, we are far past this point.
            <br>
            There once existed a sensitive web. A web made of individuals, deliberately choosing to form digital
            communities, not ones pushed together or artificially formed by algorithms. Their constructed digital spaces
            were messy, intimate, and exciting. Now, as we grow heavy with digital fatigue, many creative technologists
            are suggesting we look back to move forward.

            There is merit in building something slowly, line-by-line. You can meditate in the cyclical process of
            writing,
            reloading, deleting and writing again. Part of the beauty of the web as a medium is its interaction with
            time and decay, a website will continue to grow for as long as you tend to it. Handcoding websites forces us
            to think about the labor of the
            internet in ways platformatization obfuscates. This labor demands intentionality, which users can feel when
            interacting with a handcoded site. Each choice, the construction of the site itself, was deliberate.
            Intimacy lies here, in the knowledge that the creator crafted this site with the user in mind: <i>I made
                this for you.</i>
            <br>
            What has been hidden from us in the smoothing over of our lives is that technology exists to connect us with
            each other. This is the true allure of the web, the links we make with other users, crossing the
            geographical boundaries between us. Self-commodification and algorithms that dictate interactions make
            organic connections difficult. The sleekness of social media platforms encourages the veneer of perfection
            from its users, the presentation of a carefully curated, airbrushed, "authentic" self. A human-centered web
            encourages imperfection. It is only through revealing these imperfections that we can truly know each other.
            <br>
            Before it was in our homes, the internet existed, here, beneath our feet. It's elemental properties are as
            natural as we are. You are just as capable of harnessing these elements as any software developer. The
            potential for a sensitive web lies within all of us.
            Our lives are not data, we cannot be optimized. I encourage you to embrace difficulty and inconvience, I
            encourage you to sit with discomfort. Understand these practices as part of
            your nature, commit to bettering yourself in a world that insists you stagnate. If we want a more human
            internet, we must understand our humanity first.
            Liberate yourself, create something small.
